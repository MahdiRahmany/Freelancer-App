- **`lint`**: Runs ESLint to analyze code for potential errors and maintain code quality.
- **`preview`**: Previews the production build locally.

## Usage

After completing the installation steps:

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (default Vite port).

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized production build will be available in the `dist` directory.

3. **Preview the production build:**
